This repository contains some of the materials used for the manuscript "GTRpmix: A linked general-time reversible model for profile mixture models"

The nexus file Matrices_GTR20.nex contains in nexus format the matrices EAL, ELM, ELM50, MXM, MXMfix, and FM  described in the main manuscript.

The folder trees contain the Newick format for  trees depicted in the Supplementary material Figures S1, S10, and S11 (denoted Sim1.treefile, ELM.treefile, and EAL.treefile) and another tree ELM_50tax.treefile. The tree 'Sim1.treefile' was used to generate the simulations described in the section 'Parameter Estimation Performance' of the main manuscript. The trees ELM.treefile, ELM_50tax.treefile, and EAL.treefile were used to create the matrices ELM, ELM50, and ELM, respectively, as described in the main manuscript.
